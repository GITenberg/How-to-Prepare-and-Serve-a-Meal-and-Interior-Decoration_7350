<h2 id="hpsm1">CHAPTER I: BEFORE THE MEAL IS SERVED</h2>

<p>Before the meal which is to be served comes from the kitchen
by way of the butler&rsquo;s pantry to the dining room, there
are many things to be considered. The preparation of the meal
(not the process of its cooking, but its <i>planning</i> as a
composite whole) and all the various details which precede the
actual sitting down at the table of those who expect to enjoy
it, must be seen to. The preparation of the meal, its
<i>menu</i>, will be dealt with later, in connection with the
meal itself. For the present we will concentrate on its
preparatory aspects.</p>

<h3>IN THE BUTLER&rsquo;S PANTRY</h3>

<p>The butler&rsquo;s pantry is the connecting link between
kitchen and dining room. It is at the same time an
arsenal and a reserve line, equipped with requisites
to meet all emergencies. The perfect butler&rsquo;s
pantry should contain everything, from vegetable brushes
for cleaning celery to a galvanized refuse can. In
between come matches, bread boards, soap, ammonia
and washing soda, a dish drainer, every kind of towel,
cheesecloth and holder, strainers (for tea, coffee
and punch), ice water, punch and soup pitchers of
enamel ware, the tools and seasonings for salad making,
cut-glass brushes, and knives of different sizes.</p>

<p>In the butler&rsquo;s pantry the soiled linen should
be kept, if possible in a hamper, if not, in a bag.
There should also be a towel rack, an electric or
hot-water heater for keeping food hot and&mdash;we
are speaking of the ideal pantry, of course&mdash;a
small icebox where table butter, cream and salad dressing
may be kept, and plates chilled for serving cold dishes.
Adding a linen closet with shelves, a chest of drawers
(for tablecloths, napkins, doilies, centerpieces, <i>etc</i>.)
and the necessary shelves for china and glass (hang
your cups and save space!), and we may leave the butler&rsquo;s
pantry and enter the dining room.</p>

<h3>BEFORE ANYTHING EDIBLE COMES TO THE TABLE</h3>

<p>We will not waste time on directions regarding the
laying of the tablecloth. Only remember that it must
form a true line through the center of the table (your
&ldquo;silence cloth&rdquo; had best be of table padding,
a doubled cotton flannel or asbestos) and not hang
below the table less than nine inches. The usual arrangement
of the centerpiece in the center of the table (the
table itself being immediately under the light, unless
the waitress is thereby prevented from moving between
the table and sideboard) with its dish of fruit or
ferns or flowers (never so high as to cut off view
or conversation) can be varied to suit individual
taste. But the covers (the plates, glasses, napkin
and silver of each individual) must always be in line,
opposite each other on the opposite sides of the table.
The plate doilies indicate the covers when a bare
table is laid. The service plate which each person
receives stays where put unless it is replaced by a
hot plate.</p>

<h3>NAPKINS, SILVER, CHINA AND GLASS</h3>

<p>Napkins (fold flat and square) lie at the left of
the forks. The hem of the napkin, turned up, should
parallel the forks and the table edge.</p>

<p>When dinner is served without a maid, everything yields
to avoiding leaving the table. In that case put on
the dessert silver (which otherwise should not be
done) with the other dinner silver. Place all silver
in its order of use, and remember that three forks
are enough. If more are needed let them appear with
the courses which demand them. The quietest and therefore
most desirable way of putting the dessert silver on
the table, is to serve it from a napkin, from the right.
Knives should have their cutting edge toward the plate,
at its right, and lie half an inch from the table
edge. Spoons, bowls facing upward, lie at the right
of the knife; forks at the left of the plate. When
shell food is served (clams, oysters or mussels) the
fork is placed at the right of the plate. The upper
right-hand side of the bread and butter plate is the
place for the butter spreader.</p>

<p>In general do not arrange your cover too loosely,
and see to it that the glass, china and silver for
each cover sets close without the pieces touching.
Glasses are placed just above the knives, a little
to the right. Neither cups nor glasses should ever
be filled to the brim. The bread and butter plate
(bread and butter are, as a rule, <i>not</i> served
with <i>formal</i> dinners) somewhat to the left, beyond
the service plate. Between each two covers, or just
in front of each, place your pepper and salt sets.
The salt spoon lies across the open saltcellar.</p>

<p>When the table is set for some impromptu meal at which
a knife will not be used, the fork takes the place
of the knife at the right-hand side, and the teaspoon
is laid beside the fork.</p>

<h3>DESIRABLE IMPROVEMENTS</h3>

<p>No one wants to see the inner economy of the butler&rsquo;s
pantry, nor should the perhaps fragrant but cloying
odors of the kitchen be wafted into the dining room
whenever the swingdoor of the pantry opens or closes.
The screen obviates both disadvantages. Another improvement
has been the introduction of the serving table in
place of the sideboard. It now conveniently holds
all the extras needed for the meal.</p>

<h1 id="hpsm2">CHAPTER II: ENTER THE WAITRESS</h1>

<p>The waitress has already been busy, as we have seen,
laying the cloth and covers for the meal. Now, however,
she must live up more closely to the implied meaning
of her name. Either the hostess or the daughter of
the family who is acting as waitress, or the waitress
herself announces the meal. For informal service,
with a member of the family acting as a waitress,
the former may quietly leave the table to attend to
the bringing on or carrying off of a course, or to
supplying water, butter, <i>etc</i>. But the same care
and attention to everyone&rsquo;s needs is expected
of her as of a regular waitress. Water, butter, rolls,
bread, <i>etc</i>., should never have to be asked for.
Within reach of hand the waitress should always have
a soft napkin to remove any liquid spilled during the
meal, at once covering the spot with a fresh doily.
She must see to it that there are hot plates for hot
dishes, and chilled plates for cold ones.</p>

<h3>THE MAID AT THE TABLE</h3>

<p>The waitress should serve and remove everything, except
beverages and extra silver from the guest&rsquo;s
<i>left</i>. Fork and spoon should always be easily
at hand for the person served, and dishes should <i>never</i>
be offered and removed by <i>reaching across a cover</i>.
Remove glasses, cups and saucers from the <i>right</i>,
and serve all beverages from the right. Plates should
be placed and removed, one by one. Two plates of food
(especially salads or soup) may be brought into the
dining room at the same time, but <i>one should be
left on the serving table</i>.</p>

<p>The host is served last, the hostess first, then the
guest of honor (at the hostess&rsquo; right), then
the guest at the right of the host, and so on till
all have been served.</p>

<p>Waitresses should <i>not</i> grasp the edge of the
plate or put the thumb over the rim in placing or
handling.  The left hand should always be used for
removing plates. Take away with each course whatever
 is needed for a later one, large dishes of food,
soiled china, glass and silver. Then crumb the table
with a small plate and clean, folded napkin.</p>

<p>When serving dishes of food do so with a dinner napkin
folded square on the palm of the hand. The serving
dish should be held firmly and not too high. If necessary
steady with right hand on edge of dish. Close contact
with the person served always should be avoided. The
serving tray comes into its own for removing or passing
cream and sugar, pepper and salt, <i>etc</i>. Candies,
salted nuts, water and wineglasses  stay on the table
until the meal is over.</p>

<p>In clearing the table remove glass and silver first,
brush up crumbs which may have fallen on the floor,
and carefully shake, fold and put away the table linen.</p>

<h2 id="hpsm3">CHAPTER III: BREAKFAST</h2>

<p>Breakfast is the first meal of the American day. It
should be daintily and deftly served. Fruit, cereal
and some main dish (bacon, fish, eggs) together with
toast, hot rolls or muffins, coffee, tea or cocoa,
are its main essentials. The bare, doilied table is
popular for breakfast use.</p>

<h3>BREAKFAST FRUIT</h3>

<p>Fresh pears, plums, peaches, apricots, nectarines,
mandarins and apples are all served in the same manner&mdash;on
a plate about six inches across, with a silver fruit
knife for quartering and peeling. If a waitress serves,
fruit knife and plate are placed first, and then the
dish containing the fruit is passed.</p>

<p>Berries&mdash;raspberries, blackberries, blueberries,
strawberries, as also baked apples, stewed fruits
(peaches, prunes and apricots) and all cooked fruits,
are offered in little fruit dishes on service plates,
together with powdered (or fine granulated) sugar and
cream. Strawberries are sometimes left unhulled, when
of &ldquo;exhibition&rdquo; size. They then should
be served in apple bowls or plates, with powdered
sugar on the side.</p>

<p>In serving grapes, the waitress, after supplying fruit
plates, passes a compote containing the grapes and
offers fruit shears, so that each guest may cut what
he or she desire. Cherries are served in the same
manner, with the addition of a finger bowl.</p>

<p>When grapefruit is served, it is usually as a half,
the core removed and sugar added, on a fruit plate
or in a grapefruit bowl, together with an orange spoon.</p>

<p>Oranges may be served from a compote, whole, and may
be eaten cut crosswise in halves, with the orange
spoon; or peeled and eaten in sections. If oranges
are served peeled and sliced on a fruit plate they
may be eaten with a fork. Sugar should always be passed
when they are eaten in this way. Orange juice is the
extracted juice served in small glasses two-thirds
full.</p>

<p>Cantaloupe (filled with cracked ice) and honeydew
melon (it is smart to accompany the latter with a
slice of lemon) are served in halves or quarters,
on fruit plates (or special melon dishes) and eaten
with a fruit spoon. Sugar, salt and pepper should
be offered with these by the waitress. Watermelon
is usually cut in wedges or circles. It should always
be served very cold, on a large fruit plate, and with
fruit knife and fork. If half-melons are served, with
the rind, the host cuts egg-shaped pieces from the
fruit, and places it on individual plates for passing
by the waitress.</p>

<p>Bananas may be served &ldquo;in the skin&rdquo; at
breakfast, or peeled and sliced, with sugar and cream,
or sprinkled with sugar and lemon juice.</p>

<p>Shredded pineapple, sprinkled with sugar, or sliced
pineapple (slices an inch thick) may be served from
a large dish by the waitress.</p>

<p>Fruit at breakfast does not <i>necessarily</i> demand
a waitress. In may be served at each cover before
the guests and family seat themselves. It does call
for a finger bowl, however. Only when berries or sliced
fruits are served can the finger bowl be omitted.</p>

<h3>CEREALS</h3>

<p>Cereals are a matter of personal taste. Cooked cereals,
such as oatmeal, rolled oats, hominy, corn-meal mush
and cracked wheat should come on the table hot, and
be served in bowls with sugar (brown sugar, if preferred)
and cream. Again, the host may serve the cereal from
a large porringer, the waitress bringing him the individual
bowls, and taking them to the guests when filled.
Dry cereals are served in the same way. Puffed grains
or flakes gain crispness and flavor when reheated,
<i>not browned</i>, before serving.</p>

<h3>TOAST</h3>

<p>The best breakfast toast is that made at the table
over an electric toaster. Be sure, if you have French
toast, hot cakes or waffles served, that they come
from the kitchen <i>hot</i>. A perforated silver cover
should cover the plate containing them to prevent their
cooling. <i>Never use a soup plate or bowl for the
purpose!</i> The steam cannot escape and the toast
grows soggy. Do not forget syrup when waffles, hot
cakes or French toast are served. Some prefer cinnamon
and sugar to syrup with hot cakes, and they should
also be on hand.</p>

<h3>BACON</h3>

<p>Bacon is the ideal breakfast meat. The rasher of bacon
should be served piping hot on a hot silver platter,
in crisp, curling slices. Incidentally, it should
be just as crisp when it appears with a favorite companion,
as &ldquo;bacon and eggs.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>EGGS</h3>

<p>Cooked in the shell (medium or soft-boiled) eggs should
be served in an egg cup or egg glass, on a plate,
and <i>under cup or glass</i>. Each egg thus served
should be accompanied by a silver egg cutter and (unless
there is plenty of silver at the cover) a silver spoon.</p>

<p>A vegetable dish or a small plate will do for the
hard-boiled egg.</p>

<p>Poached eggs appear in individual shirred egg dishes,
to the left of each cover, on small plates with service
spoon.</p>

<p>Scrambled eggs are served in individual portions,
as above; or distributed by the host from a large
platter, and passed by the waitress.</p>

<p>Omelet should be served on a large platter with hot
individual service plates before the host. The waitress
may pass the individual portions or&mdash;it
is customary with scrambled eggs&mdash;they may
be passed from host to guest around the table.</p>

<h3>COFFEE</h3>

<p>Coffee is the favorite and logical breakfast drink,
though some prefer tea, cocoa and milk. The breakfast
coffee service should be placed before the hostess.
In its most attractive form it comprises a large silver
tray, which holds coffee (or percolator), the hot-water
pot, creamer, sugar bowl with tongs, and cups and
saucers. (There may also be a bowl for the water used
to heat the cups.) When tea is the breakfast beverage
the samovar takes the place of the percolator.</p>

<p>The large silver service platter may be dispensed
with, if desired, in favor of a tile to hold the coffee
urn, the other components of the service being grouped
about it. There is a charming touch of intimacy about
coffee made at the table with an electric percolator,
poured by the hostess and passed at the table (or
by a waitress). When the hostess pours she should
at the same time ask the guest&rsquo;s preferences
(those of members of the family are supposed to be
known) as regards cream and sugar. Cream and sugar
always enter the cup <i>first</i>! The true coffee-drinker
at once notices a difference in flavor if the coffee
first be poured, and the cream and sugar added.</p>

<h3>FOR THE CHILDREN</h3>

<p>If the children eat breakfast with the family, a regular
child&rsquo;s service, with attractive little knives
and spoons should be provided, and his whole service,
preferably, should be arranged on a tray near the
table&rsquo;s edge. Every child likes to have his own
porridge bowl, his mug and little milk pitcher, and
having his own table tools teaches him to be neat
and self-reliant.</p>

<h2 id="hpsm4">CHAPTER IV: LUNCHEONS</h2>

<h3>THE INFORMAL LUNCHEON</h3>

<p>The informal luncheon or lunch&mdash;originally
the light meal eaten between breakfast and dinner,
but now often taking the place of dinner, the fashionable
hour being one (or half after if cards are to follow)&mdash;is
of two kinds. The &ldquo;buffet&rdquo; luncheon, at
which the guests eat standing; and the luncheon served
at small tables, at which the guests are seated. (In
general all that is here said with regard to the &ldquo;buffet&rdquo;
luncheon, applies to the &ldquo;buffet&rdquo; supper
or evening &ldquo;spread.&rdquo; The only actual difference
is that lighted candles may be used at an evening
luncheon, and that the daytime luncheon may offer courses
more variegated and solid in character than would
be suitable for evening eating.)</p>

<p>Plates, silver and napkins are conveniently arranged
on a laid table in the case of the &ldquo;buffet&rdquo;
lunch. One or two hot and one or two cold dishes (according
to the number of guests who are to be fed), and one
or two iced desserts with one cream or jelly in mold
should be sufficient. The knife is tabooed at the
&ldquo;buffet&rdquo; lunch, hence all the food must
be such as can be eaten with fork or spoon. As a rule,
friends of the hostess serve (host and hostess may
help), though, if convenient, waitresses may see to
the wants of the guests. To keep the table from looking
crowded, maids may replenish the dishes from pantry
or serving table as may be necessary. Plates of sandwiches
or filled rolls (not too far from the table edge)
olives and relishes should also be arranged on the
table, though cakes, candies and salted nuts may be
passed by the maids. The rolls go with the hot course,
the sandwiches with the salad. When a &ldquo;buffet&rdquo;
lunch is served at a big reception, with any number
of guests coming and going, all the buffet refreshments
should appear on the table at the same time.</p>

<p>The following dishes cover the essentials of a &ldquo;buffet&rdquo;
luncheon. Beverages: punch, coffee, chocolate (poured
from urn, or filled cups brought from pantry on tray);
hot entrées of various sorts (served from chafing
dish or platter) preceded by hot bouillon; cold entrées,
salads, lobster, potatoes, chicken, shrimp, with heavy
dressings; hot rolls, wafer-cut sandwiches (lettuce,
tomato, deviled ham, <i>etc</i>.); small cakes, frozen
creams and ices.</p>

<p>The informal luncheon at small tables calls for service
by a number of maids, hence the &ldquo;buffet&rdquo;
plan is preferable.</p>

<h3>THE FORMAL LUNCHEON</h3>

<p>A &ldquo;luncheon set&rdquo; (a luncheon cloth or
center-piece  with doilies of the same color and design)
or a bare table may be used for the formal luncheon,
with special luncheon napkins, in a three-cornered
fold. Butter is not usually served, the individual
dishes (filled) are placed at the top of the plate
without doily, and if a &ldquo;cup&rdquo; of some sort
is to be served, an apollinaris glass is placed a
little below the water glass. Bread and rolls had
best be passed, though they may be placed in or on
a napkin, instead of a bread dish. Favors, if used,
should appear at the top of the plate, or grouped
about the center-piece,  with connecting ribbons to
the plates. This is an attractive form of arrangement.
Dishes of candies and bonbons (with bonbon spoon beside
them) are placed on the table at will, wherever they
make the best appearance, but large dishes with spoon
must be taken from the serving table and passed.</p>

<h3>THE FORMAL LUNCHEON MENU</h3>

<p>The cocktail is the preliminary entering wedge of
the formal luncheon. Some hostesses serve a light
cocktail with very thin sandwiches or wafers in their
drawing room before luncheon proper is served. At the
latter the fruit cocktail (served on small plate, with
doily, glass and spoon) or a Lobster or Scallop Cocktail
(oyster fork) is followed by the first course.</p>

<p>Here there is a wide choice&mdash;Cream of Pea
soup with or without croutons, Lobster Bisque, Mock
Turtle, Consommé (Parmesan or Chicken), White Soup
with Wine&mdash;whatever best fits in with the
general scheme of the luncheon may be served. The
handles of the bouillon cup, when it is placed before
the guest, should parallel the edge of the table.</p>

<p>The passing of Bread Sticks, Olives and Radishes should
precede the removal of the bouillon cup, and the placing
before the guest of the warmed plates for the fish.
Here we have the same embarrassment of riches. Deviled
Crabs, Fried Sardines, Fish Cutlets with Dutch Sauce,
Fried Shad Roe, Oyster and Mushroom Patties, Halibut
in any style, together with rolls (passed in napkins)
and Dressed Cucumbers will answer for the fish course.</p>

<p>Before the meat course the claret cup should be poured,
the waitress ready with napkin in her left hand to
catch any drops which may spill from the pitcher.
We will merely indicate five choices for the <i>pièce
de résistance</i> of the formal luncheon, 1. Fillets
of Beef, with Raisin Sauce, Parisian Potatoes (ball-shaped)
and French Peas. 2. Broiled Wild Duck, Curried Vegetables,
and Currant Jelly Sauce. 3. Fried Chicken with Tomato
Mayonnaise, Steamed New Potatoes and Boiled Green
Corn. 4. Squab Breasts larded around hot ripe Olives,
with Brown Sauce, and Potato Croquettes with Peas.
5. Roast Saddle of Venison, with Sauté Potato Balls
and Broiled Tomatoes with Horseradish Hollandaise
Sauce. None of these combinations should disappoint
a formal luncheon guest. When this course is over,
the salad should be substituted for the dinner plate
which has been removed.</p>

<p>The salad is by no means the least attractive among
the courses. You may have Pepper and Fruit Salad,
with Nut-Bread Sandwiches or an Asparagus Salad with
Lemon Rings. You may incline to Spring Salad with
Horseradish Sandwiches or to Dressed Lettuce with Cheese-Bread
Wafers. Or, again, you may prefer Chicory Salad with
Cheese Croquettes. You have but to choose. With the
passing of the salad and its sandwiches, salt and
pepper sets are removed, the table is crumbed and the
ice-cream plates are laid out, together with ice-cream
forks and spoons.</p>

<p>Will you have Maroon Ice Cream with Sponge Drops or
a Tutti-Frutti Ice? Canton Mousse with Cream Cones,
or Orange Cream Sherbet with Chocolate Petits Fours?
Chocolate Parfait with Lady Fingers or Frozen Neapolitan
Charlotte with Marshmallow Wafers? You must exercise
your individual choice among these and a hundred others.</p>

<p>The passing of the finger-bowl service (plate, bowl
and doily) precedes the appearance of the demi-tasse,
and the passing of candies and bonbons. (At less formal
luncheons, the hostess pours the coffee at the table.
When this is done the service usually is placed before
her when the dessert course ends.)</p>

<p>The more formal luncheon dictates that coffee be served
in the drawing room. Here the waitress passes the
after-dinner coffee which the hostess pours. If it
seems preferrable to serve coffee at the table, the
waitress, after she has placed the finger-bowl service,
puts the coffee at the guest&rsquo;s left hand, and
passes him cream and sugar. When he has removed his
finger bowl the guest uses the plate for his bonbons.</p>

<h2 id="hpsm5">CHAPTER V: THE INFORMAL (HOME) DINNER</h2>

<p>The setting of the table for the home dinner follows
the general rules already given. As it is a quite
informal affair, however, the side dish (never seen
at a formal dinner) is permissible. Dessert, too, may
be served in a small dish set in a plate. A carving
cloth (for <i>paterfamilias</i> usually carves at
the home dinner) protects the tablecloth from spatters
and bits of crisp fat which the most skillful carver
cannot always avoid sending over the dish.</p>

<p>If a maid serves, she should always have an extra
plate, one more than the number of individuals to
be served. She will need it.</p>

<p>A salad served with meat, at an informal dinner, is
placed on the right side, <i>from the right</i>, the
exception to the rule of serving from the left.</p>

<p>Vegetables, once served, are taken back to the kitchen,
to keep them warm. If a second serving is desired,
the mistress rings. Suit yourself about having the
serving silver placed on the table <i>before</i> the
dish to be served is carried in. The latest wrinkle&mdash;and
it is a time and step-saving one&mdash;dictates
that the silver be brought in on a platter. The soup,
to be served hot (it should always be served in soup
plates at dinner and never in bouillon cups) must be
brought in after the family have taken their places.</p>

<p>A family dinner may be served quite comfortably even
without a maid. The table set and the service laid,
the younger members of the family should attend to
her duties. One may bring in the soup, hot, in individually
heated plates. Another may fill the water glasses,
pass butter or sauces and remove dishes between courses.
The most convenient way of serving vegetables, under
these circumstances, is for some member of the family
next the carver to attend to it, as soon as meat has
been laid on the plate. It saves extra passing. See
to it that too many things&mdash;butter, salt,
pepper, cream, sauces, <i>etc</i>.&mdash;are not
traveling about the table at once. All the formal features
of the more formal meals may be dropped or modified
to suit individual needs or circumstances in the informal
home dinner.</p>

<h2 id="hpsm6">CHAPTER VI: THE FORMAL DINNER</h2>

<p>From the informal dinner in which the family waits
on itself, to the formal dinner, at which two waitresses
attend to the comfort of the diners, is but a step.
Yet it is a serious one for the hostess who gives
the latter form of dinner. The cook often requires
extra help (dishwashing, <i>etc</i>.); and where a chambermaid
is available, she has to be drafted as a second waitress
or an extra waitress engaged. There must be a helper
on duty in the pantry, for there must be no hitch in
any detail of the formal dinner service. So the extra
pantry-hand must serve soup and pour coffee, see that
there is crushed ice always ready, stack up soiled
dishes, open wine bottles (yes, this is still done!)
and be prepared to do anything else which will help
make the dinner a success.</p>

<h3>THE WHAT&rsquo;S WHAT OF A FORMAL DINNER</h3>

<p>The fine damask tablecloth is a feature&mdash;though
the table is set practically as though for a formal
luncheon&mdash;and large-size dinner napkins
are the rule. The parsnips of circumstance are not
buttered at the formal dinner, though the bread and
butter plate sometimes shows its face as a serving
convenience for bread, celery, olives and radishes.
Wineglasses still appear in formal dinners given <i>in
private</i>. This provides for quite an array of glassware.
At the point of the knives, in the following order
stand the water goblet and the iced tea glass or appolinaris
glass. The wineglasses (usually no more than three
wines are served) are grouped to the right of the water
goblet. Their order is that of use. (There are separate
glasses for high and low cocktail, sherry, sauterne,
claret, champagne, cordials and whiskey.) Each guest
has his own nut dish, placed directly before him.
Candles are lit and water glasses  half-filled a few
minutes in advance of the dinner announcement, and
the hostess already having arranged place cards before
this is done.</p>

<h3>THE COURSES</h3>

<p>The &ldquo;initial&rdquo; course may be placed on
the table before dinner is announced or may be served
after. If, however, you serve cocktails in the drawing
room with the accompanying caviar or lettuce sandwiches,
or if you serve a canapé, do not repeat the latter
as the opening of the dinner. For instance, you should
not serve a Lobster Canapé in the drawing room and
a Finnan Haddie Canapé at the dinner table. Fruit
cocktails of every kind, and canapés are in order for
this commencement of the meal.</p>

<h3>A GOOD FRUIT COCKTAIL RECIPE</h3>

<p>Mix shredded pineapple, halved strawberries, (fresh,
not preserved), with grapefruit pulp, the pulp in
a two to one proportion to the pineapple, chill and
cover with wine dressing. To be served in champagne
glass, with top garnish of a large strawberry for each
glass.</p>

<p>The soup course may be preceded by one of fruit, where
the cocktail or canapé has been served in the drawing
room. Supposing it to be strawberries, the berries
will already be waiting in a small plate when the
guests take their seats upon entering the dining room.
They should be unhulled, large, selected berries,
and may be eaten either by hand (dipped in the sugar
mound into which they are thrust on the plate) or
with the strawberry fork. The serving of a finger bowl
with this course is a matter of taste.</p>

<p>When this course has been removed, the soup is served,
and the head waitress pours the sherry, while cakes
and olives are passed by a second waitress.</p>

<p>If fish comes next&mdash;we will presume the
fish to be Shad à la Delmonico, Halibut à la Meniere
or Turbans of Flounder&mdash;it is passed in the
platter, followed by rolls and Cucumber Ribbons, Dressed
Cucumbers or Sliced Cucumbers, as the case may be.
Then the fish course is taken from the table and we
come to the entrée.</p>

<p>If one entrée is the limit it precedes the roast.
Where you have two entrées the heavy (meat) entrée
comes first, then the lighter (vegetable) one. Let
us say we have only Delmonico Tomatoes or Mushroom
Croquettes. We would carry on next with our roast fowl
or flesh. But if we have Oyster and Mushroom Patties
<i>and</i> Roast Ham with Cider Sauce as entrées,
the Roast Ham, being the heavier, should be served
first.</p>

<p>Our roast&mdash;the champagne was poured from
the <i>right</i> side with the <i>right</i> hand <i>after</i>
the removal of the fish plates&mdash;is now due.
The entrée plates in turn have been taken away and
the warm dinner plates substituted for them. Ah, the
roast! What shall it be? There is so much from which
to choose. It cannot be too epicurean for a formal
dinner. Fillet of Beef Larded with Truffles, with a
Brown Mushroom Sauce; Crown of Lamb (crowned with
Green Peas and surrounded by Fried Potato Balls);
Roast Turkey with Truffle Gravy; Venison Saddle, Chateaubriand
of Beef, Sirloin Steak, there is no lack of choice.</p>

<p>When both roast and game are served, a frozen punch
is supposed to draw the line of demarcation between
them, and the salad enters <i>with</i> the game instead
of being counted as an individual  course.</p>

<p>While one waitress passes the roast, another follows
 with the potatoes. Other vegetables and rolls then
come in order and, if the nut dishes of any of the
guests are empty, they are refilled.</p>

<p>When more than a single meat course is served at a
formal dinner, the sorbets and frozen punches should
be dropped. In such a case they are only permissible
at an especially large official dinner, a banquet or
a large hotel spread.</p>

<p>After dinner plates have been taken away the salad
(already arranged on the plate, the fork on the right
hand side) is served from the right, and sandwiches
are passed. The variety of possible salads has already
been alluded to in the consideration  of the formal
luncheon, hence nothing need be added here on that
head.</p>

<p>With the emptied salad plate are removed peppers
and salts (on tray) and the table crumbed, the ice
cream plate (as at the formal luncheon) is placed.
The ice cream mold is passed with <i>the mold already
cut, but retaining its shape</i>, to facilitate the
guest&rsquo;s helping himself. Together with the ice
cream, the accompanying small cakes are passed.</p>

<p>The appearance of the finger bowl service follows
the removal of the dessert plates. The finger bowl
should be approximately one-fourth full of luke-warm
 water (never cold) and garnished. The dessert  plate
is removed with the left hand, the plate, finger bowl,
and doily served with the left. The passing of the
bonbons concludes the actual service at the table.</p>

<p>Coffee, as already mentioned, is poured by the hostess
in the drawing room and, after the waitress has collected
and removed the coffee service (and cups and saucers)
she may, in the event that cordials  are served, return
with the cordial service, which the hostess pours and
the waitress serves as in the case of the coffee.</p>

<p>If the ladies <i>only</i> retire to the drawing room,
one waitress serves them there with coffee, while
another remains in the dining room. Here she passes
cigars and cigarettes on a tray, together with a lighted
candle or matches, and then serves coffee and cordials
or brandy and soda.</p>

<p>It is good form for the waitress to serve carbonated
 water in apollinaris glasses in the drawing room
about an hour after the conclusion of the dinner.</p>

<h2 id="hpsm7">CHAPTER VII: AFTERNOON TEAS</h2>

<p>Afternoon teas are of two kinds, formal and informal,
and the informal outdoor tea in the open, on the lawn
or in the garden, is a variant of the latter variety.
Here the tea wagon comes into play, and tea is often
tea in name only, since at summer outdoor teas not
only iced tea, but iced coffee, iced chocolate or
punch are often served.</p>

<h3>THE INFORMAL TEA</h3>

<p>Do not set a table for the informal tea. The tea service
is merely brought to the sun parlor, drawing room
or living room in which the tea is to be served, and
placed on the table. There the hostess makes and pours
the tea, unless she prefers to have it brought in on
a tea tray already made for pouring.</p>

<p>The tea service comprises: a teakettle for boiling
water with filled alcohol lamp and matches; a tea
caddy with teaspoon and (if only a few cups are to
be made) a tea ball. A tea creamer, cut sugar, a saucer
of sliced lemon, and cups and saucers with spoon on
cup saucer, as well as tea napkins complete the service.
The water brought in in the teakettle should be hot.
If this precaution is observed, the tea will boil very
soon after the lamp is lighted. The sandwiches served
at an informal afternoon tea should be very simple:
lettuce, olive or nut butter, or plain bread and butter,
nor should the small cakes also passed be elaborate
or rich.</p>

<h3>THE FORMAL TEA</h3>

<p>The formal tea&mdash;a tea becomes formal as
soon as cards are sent out for it&mdash;is a
very different affair. As many as four ladies may pour,
two during the first, and two during the second hour.
Friends of the hostess&mdash;they serve all refreshments,
though waitresses assist, removing soiled cups and
plates and bringing in fresh ones&mdash;preside
at either table end, and the table is decorated (flowers
and candles). At one end of the luncheon cloth (or
the table may be laid with doilies) stands the service
tray, with teapot, hot-water pot, creamer, sugar bowl
with tongs and cut sugar, and sliced lemons in dish
with lemon fork. The tray also contains cup and saucers
(each saucer with spoon, handle paralleling cup).
The coffee, bouillon or chocolate service is established
 in the same manner at the other end of the table.
If coffee is served, the service tray is equipped
with urn, cream and sugar; if chocolate, whipped cream
in bowl with ladle; if bouillon, the urn alone.</p>

<p>Each lady who pours must have a large napkin convenient
to guard her gown. Arranged along the table should
be plates of sandwiches and cakes, bonbon dishes and
dishes with salted nuts. But the table must not be
crowded. This important  rule is responsible for the
existence of the frappé table.</p>

<p>The frappé table holds the afternoon tea punch. Since
the dining room is apt to be well filled as it is,
the frappé table had best be established in some other
room. On its luncheon cloth is set the punch or frappé
bowl with ladle, and individual ices, frozen creams
(not too rich or elaborate) or punch are served in
frappé or punch bowls by a friend of the hostess.
The small plates on which the frappé glasses are served
should be piled on the table with doilies (<i>linen
always</i>) between the plates. When served, the glass
is filled with the sherbet or cream, and a sherbet
spoon laid at the right-hand side of plate (a tray
of sherbet spoons belongs to the frappé table equipment,
as well as a filled cake basket, dishes of candy,
piles of small plates and small linen napkins). Unless
you are entertaining guests to the number of a hundred
or more, <i>never use paper doilies at a formal afternoon
tea</i>!</p>

<p>A pretty custom dictates that young girl friends of
the hostess serve the guests. They provide the latter
with plate and napkin, ask their choice of beverage,
and serve it, together with sandwiches and cakes.
Or the plates and napkins may be handed the guests
as they enter by a waitress stationed  at the door,
before they are served by the young girls.</p>

<p><i>A salad should never be offered at a formal afternoon
tea</i>! To do so is to commit a social solecism.</p>

<h2 id="hpsm8">CHAPTER VIII: SUPPERS</h2>

<p>Supper, &ldquo;the evening meal,&rdquo; the last of
the day, in modern usage often is actually a dinner,
the most elaborate meal; the place of the former dinner
being taken by the luncheon. A supper is often a particularly
elaborate dinner or banquet, as, for instance,  the
&ldquo;class supper.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE LATE SUPPER</h3>

<p>The late supper, often given after a theatre party,
or a card party, is always an informal affair. Its
favorite form is what might be called the &ldquo;chafing
dish supper,&rdquo; where should they wish, the guests
may help themselves.</p>

<p>Two chafing dishes or one may grace the table (laid
with luncheon cloth or luncheon set, flowers and candles)
according to the number of guests. The chafing dish
is set before the hostess on a metal tray resting
on an asbestos mat.  A teakettle of boiling water,
an electric toaster (the asbestos mat of the chafing
dish laid over the flame may also be used for keeping
toast or croutons made in the kitchen warm while on
the table), and plates already heated go with the chafing
dish.  Also, near at hand, should be matches, an extra
napkin, a &ldquo;sampling&rdquo; fork and spoon, and
a bowl of some sort for burned matches and the &ldquo;sampling
silver.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All that is to be cooked, dry or liquid, should already
 have been measured and be ready for use. All bowls,
small dishes and pitchers containing ingredients for
any one dish should be grouped on a single tray, at
the left of the person attending to the chafing dish.</p>

<p>Chafing-dish rarebits may be of every kind, and every
rarebit should have some main dominating flavor, as
green or red pepper, onion, tomato, <i>etc</i>. Cheese
souffles or sweet souffles are also successful chafing-dish
products, as well as cooked fish heated in a piquant
sauce.</p>

<p>For chafing-dish purposes there are available: <i>Meats</i>:
Beef, Venison, Lamb, Cooked Tongue, Bacon and Ham,
Chicken, Chicken Livers and Sweetbreads. <i>Sea Food</i>:
Lobster, Terrapin, Crab Meat, Frogs&rsquo; Legs, Oysters,
Shrimps, Scallops, Sardines,  Salmon and Finnan Haddie.
Eggs, Cheese, Tomatoes, Mushrooms and Peas should also
be included with this list.</p>

<p>Sliced and toasted bread or crackers heated usually
form the basis of the chafing-dish preparation.  Rarebits
suppose toast or crackers, but creamed dishes demand
toast. The chafing dish also pays homage to the sweet
tooth in the shape of fudges (Ginger, Nut Raisin, Peanut
Butter, Marshmallow,  <i>etc</i>.); and hot coffee,
wine cup, mineral water, beer, ale and cider are the
customary chafing-dish  supper drinkables.</p>

<h2 id="hpsm9">CHAPTER IX: OUTSIDE THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT</h2>

<p>From the alcoholic beverages of the chafing-dish supper
to those of the dinner is a natural transition. At
the formal dinner wines often accompany  the courses
and, as already mentioned, liqueurs and cordials supply
the final liquid note after the coffee. The theory
of alcoholic beverages at the formal dinner is a simple
one. Certain fixed and definite rules obtain and are
generally observed. Three wines may be served, though
the best social form prefers one or two.</p>

<h3>SHERRY OR MADEIRA</h3>

<p>Sherry or Madeira may accompany the soup course. They
should be poured <i>after</i> the soup has been placed,
and served from a decanter. In general wine should
always be poured slowly, and glasses should be filled
only two-thirds. The etiquette is for the waitress
to pour a little wine into the host&rsquo;s glass,
then filling the glasses beginning at the host&rsquo;s
right. Sherry should always be served cold, at a temperature
of 40&deg; Fahrenheit; the Madeira may be served at a
temperature of 65&deg; F., or that of the room.</p>

<h3>SAUTERNE OR RHINE WINE</h3>

<p>Sauterne or Rhine Wine go with the fish course. They
are poured, like the Claret, at the end of the preceding
course, before the next course comes on. They (like
Sparkling Burgundy and Champagne) are served from
the bottle, and the bottle should be held in a folded
napkin or bottle holder. The mean average temperature
of Sauterne should be 50&deg; F. Some prefer it decidedly
cold (chilled in the icebox), others only slightly
cold. Rhine Wine should always be cold: 40&deg; F.</p>

<h3>CLARET</h3>

<p>Claret is the wine for the entrée and, as a rule,
is served from a claret pitcher. Being a light wine,
it may be served <i>with</i> the Champagne and <i>instead</i>
of it to those who do not prefer the Mumm. Claret
should be poured at the end of the course <i>immediately</i>
before the one with which it is served. The room temperature
or one of 65&deg; F. is the proper one for Claret.</p>

<h3>CHAMPAGNE, BURGUNDY OR PORT</h3>

<p>These wines are served with the meat courses. In order
that Champagne or Sparkling Burgundy may come on the
table at the proper temperature (Champagne 35&deg; and
Burgundy 70&deg; F.) it must be ice-packed  for several
hours before serving. Care must be taken, however,
that it does not frappé when, if required at short
notice, it is salt-and-ice packed half an hour before
serving. Sweet Champagne, on the other hand, is improved
in flavor if slightly frappéed. It should always be
served very cold. Like Sauterne, Champagne and Burgundy
are served from the bottle. In serving them the wire
should be cut, and the cork carefully <i>worked</i>
out of the bottle by pressing it up with the thumbs.
It is wise to work out the cork <i>under the edge
of the table</i>, since it is sometimes projected
with much power. The temperature for Port is 55&deg; F.</p>

<h3>CORDIALS AND LIQUEURS</h3>

<p>Cordial glasses holding a small quantity are used
for serving these sweet, aromatic beverages. Cordials
are served plain, with crushed ice or with cream.
In serving Crême de Menthe the straw is unusual in
private home service, though customary in some hotels.
Crême de Menthe glasses should be filled two-thirds
full with fine crushed ice, then a little of the cordial
poured over it. Chartreuse (green or yellow), Benedictine,
Grenadine, Apricot Brandy, Curacoa, and Dantzig Eau
de Vie arc usually served without additions or ice.
Benedictine or Crême de Cacoa, however, may be served
with a dash of plain or whipped cream. The exceedingly
sweet Crême Yvette should be served with cracked ice,
like Crême de Menthe. Noyau, Kirschwasser, Maraschino
and Grenadine may be served as cordials,  or reserved
for the flavoring of puddings, ices and sauces.</p>

<h2 id="hpsma">CHAPTER X: CARVING HINTS</h2>

<p>Whether it be the waitress or the master of the house
who carves, a firm hand, an appraising  eye and a
sharp carving knife are needed. Some of the chief
carving points for roasts are worth knowing.</p>

<p><i>Beefsteak (Porterhouse)</i>: Carve in two pieces,
cutting tenderloin and sirloin from the middle bone.
Cut in uniformly thick slices, serving a piece for
a portion, rare, medium or well done, as may be preferred.
 <i>Rib or Sirloin Roast</i>: Hold firmly, skin side
up. Carve in thin, parallel slices, from crisp edge
to bone, then slip knife under slices and cut from
bones. <i>Rump Steak</i>: Cut in thin, parallel slices
with grain of meat. Serve like rib or sirloin with
dish gravy for each portion. <i>Fillet of Beefs</i>:
Cut across diagonally, beginning at thick end. Slices
should be no more than half an inch thick. <i>Leg
of Lamb</i>: With rounding side up, plunge carving
fork in center of roast, and cut in thin, parallel
slices <i>across grain</i> to bone. Boned leg of lamb
is more easily carved. <i>Saddle of Mutton</i>: Make
cuts parallel  to backbone, half to three-quarters
inch apart; then crosscuts at right angles to former,
two to two and a half inches long. Slip knife beneath
bone to free meat. <i>Loin of Veal or Lamb</i>: Cut
backbone of each rib before cooking. Cut roast between
ribs, serving one for a portion. Carve <i>Crown of
Lamb</i> in the same way. <i>Roast Turkey or Roast
Chicken, Capon or Guinea Hen</i>: With bird on back,
insert carving fork across highest point of breastbone.
Holding it here firmly, cut through skin between second
joint and body, close to the latter. Pull back leg
and second joint in one piece with knife; disjoint,
then cut off wing. Breast meat must be carved in thin,
parallel slices. Use knife to part second joints from
drumsticks and carve them in slices. Always complete
carving one side of a bird before carving the other.
Light meat and dark meat, together with stuffing,
should be included in each portion, unless a preference
is indicated. <i>Broilers</i>: Should be cut in halves,
and the halves halved, severing at joints. According
to size of broiler a quarter or a half is served as
an individual portion. <i>Domestic Duck</i>: Bird on
back (drumsticks to right of carver, as with all fowl)
the carving fork is thrust through breast. The joints
lie much farther back than those of chickens or turkeys.
After removing leg and wing, make cuts in breast meat
parallel to breastbone, three-quarters of an inch apart,
and remove by sliding knife under meat. Small pieces
of rich meat, dark, may be cut from the sides of the
duck. <i>Game Duck</i>: First cut breast meat from
one side, then from other. Half a breast is the individual
portion. Legs and wings are too tough, as a rule, for
satisfactory table use.</p>

<h2 id="hpsmb">CHAPTER XI: PLANNING A MENU</h2>

<p>Food value and contrast&mdash;the avoidance of
duplicating flavors&mdash;are main points in
menu planning. An elaborate menu must alternate its
light and heavy courses.</p>

<h3>SOUP</h3>

<p>Thin soups for formal dinners, cream or thick soups
for informal ones is the rule. With Consommé, Bread
or Cheese Sticks; with thick soups Crackers or Croutons;
with Oyster Stew, Oyster Crackers are the proper thing.
Soup garnishings (clear soup) include: Shredded Sprouts,
Boiled Macaroni cut in rings, Noodles, Lemon Slices,
Italian Pastes and Grated Parmesan Cheese, and Sliced
Cooked Chestnuts and Royal Custard. Radishes, Celery
and Olives are served <i>after</i> the soup.</p>

<h3>HORS D&rsquo;OEVRES</h3>

<p>Cocktails or Canapés beginning a dinner call for plain
sandwiches or wafers. When Oysters or Clams (or any
seafood cocktails) are served, Graham or Brown Bread
Sandwiches are grateful. With oysters served raw on
shell, a Horseradish Sandwich is proper. Tabasco, Grated
Horseradish, Catsup, Cayenne, or Cocktail Sauce are
in order for oysters or clams, and a half lemon should
<i>always</i> be laid on the oyster plate.</p>

<h3>FISH</h3>

<p>Fish flavoring&rsquo;s include Lemon Juice (lemon
sliced with or without the rind, or served in quarters
or halves) or Tarragon Vinegar. Sauce Tartare is always
appropriate for fried fish. Broiled Halibut or Pompano
gain by a Sauce Hollandaise. With Baked or Broiled
Shad Cucumber Cream Sauce is in order. Broiled fish
in general should be mated with rich, heavy sauces,
and may be accompanied by Boiled Potato Balls, and
Maître d&rsquo;Hotel butter. When Halibut or Flounder
are steamed or baked in fillets, they call for a piquantly
flavored sauce: Caper, Brown Tomato, Shrimp or Lobster.
Drawn Butter Sauce, Caper or Hollandaise Sauce, are
best with Boiled Hot Salmon; Green Mayonnaise, Vinaigrette
or Sauce Tartare with Cold Boiled Salmon. Vegetables
do not properly accompany fish in a dinner of many
courses. Yet broiled fish may be served with Corn
and Shell Beans; white fish of various sorts with
Tomatoes, stuffed or fried; and Salmon with Peas.</p>

<h3>ENTREES</h3>

<p>Every entrée should have the sauce which properly
befits it. Patties, however, are not served with the
rolls which accompany other entrées, their pastry
taking its place. A Purée of Peas may be offered with
meat croquettes.</p>

<h3>SALADS</h3>

<p>For simply dressed salads Cheese Balls or croquettes
are appropriate. Fruit salads require thin, unsugared
crackers&mdash;they may be served hot, sprinkled
with mild paprika over butter. Anything of the sort
served with a salad is merely served to <i>bring out</i>
its flavor, not to destroy it!</p>

<h3>DESSERTS</h3>

<p>When the dinner is a heavy or elaborate one the heavy
pudding with a rich sauce is distinctly out of keeping.
Frappéed or cold desserts are the proper thing, served
together with small wafers or cakes. At less formal
dinners the sweet dessert may be omitted, and cheese
and hard crackers, a fruit salad, or toasted wafers
and coffee may be substituted.</p>

<h3>THE ROASTS</h3>

<p>Under this head we will list for the reader&rsquo;s
convenience a grouping of roasts, together with the
sauces and vegetables with which they may be combined
for menu purposes in a natural and satisfactory manner.</p>

<p><i>Beefsteak and Roast Beef:</i> As sauces, Mushroom
Sauce is appropriate for both; then for Beefsteak
we have Sauce Bearnaise, and Maître d&rsquo;Hotel
Butter; for the Roast Beef, Horseradish Sauce, Banana
Sauce and as an accompanying dish, Yorkshire Pudding.
Accompanying vegetables for both include: Potatoes,
white and sweet, Lima and String Beans, Macaroni,
Corn, Peas, Spinach and Onions, Eggplant and Squash,
Brussels Sprouts, Cauliflower and Tomatoes.</p>

<h1 id="id_head">INTERIOR DECORATION</h1>

<h2 id="id1">CHAPTER I: LINES AND CURVES</h2>

<p>Straight lines in a room call for straight lines in
furniture, rugs and hangings. They make a room dignified
and serious in appearance. Italian Renaissance chairs
and other pieces of that period, and our modern Craftsman
and Mission chairs (often hard and stiff examples of
the straight-line type of furniture, just as Bokhara,
Kazan and Afghan rugs are of the straight-line rug)
are furniture  of this kind. The severe line is also
produced by velvet draperies topped by straight-lined
lambrequins.  A straight line is to be preferred to
a weak curve. And it is usually possible to redeem
too straight and rigid an appearance in furniture
by relieving long, straight lines (as in tables) by
carved ornamentation and the application of curved
lines on a secondary plane, i. e., in parts of the
legs. In general, when not too rigid, straight lines
in interior  decoration stand for repose, sobriety
and dignity.</p>

<h3>CURVED LINES</h3>

<p>Curved lines in decoration and furniture are of various
kinds. The rococo styles (Louis XV and the Regency)
are overluxurious and often weak; the curves in Arabic
or Celtic ornamentation vague and obscure. The undulating
curves of Persian rugs suggest movement. Curves, in
general, which turn <i>up</i>, make an effect of animation
and happiness. Wall papers and draperies used to emphasize
such furniture curves lend an air of happy animation
to the rooms in which they are used.</p>

<p>Contrast to stiff, straight lines is afforded by the
use of the curved line in decoration, which offers
soft, rich and lovely effects. In general, curved
lines make for grace, flexibility and softness.</p>

<h3>BROKEN LINES</h3>

<p>Broken lines give us a feeling of life and movement.
 But they should not be used for the permanent  decorative
lines of a room&mdash;the lines of the walls,
openings, hangings, draperies, carpets, or large, immovable
pieces of furniture which have a fixed place. In pillows
which break the long back line of a couch, in cornice
moldings, lambrequin bottoms, chair backs, screens,
<i>etc</i>., they lend life. But as a rule they should
be sparingly used.</p>

<h3>VERTICAL LINES</h3>

<p>Vertical lines express aspiration and disquietude;
diagonal lines, action. In wall paper designs and
rug patterns the diagonal line is not always excellent.
 Diagonal lines are sometimes effective in rugs; but
the feeling of energetic movement they produce in wall
papers or drop patterns is objectionable. It annoys
the eye and is usually inartistic.</p>

<h2 id="id2">CHAPTER II: FORM, COLOR AND PROPORTION</h2>

<p>Never overemphasize one of the dimensions of <i>height,
width</i> and <i>depth</i> at the expense of one of
the others. They must be harmonized.</p>

<h3>OBLONG</h3>

<p>The proportions of any room are best when they make
a normal impression on the eye. The oblong is the
best decorative art <i>form</i>, as a rule. It can
be used in nearly all ornaments, in walls, doors and
windows, ceilings and floors, in rugs and furniture,
because it is obvious.</p>

<h3>THE SQUARE</h3>

<p>The square form is solid and firm, but tends to be
monotonous. Square windows, fireplaces and wall spaces,
as well as square rooms in general and pictures, are
usually uninteresting, and this applies to cubes as
well. The big cubical chair, for instance, is something
to be avoided.</p>

<h3>THE TRIANGLE</h3>

<p>The triangular form (in mantel clocks, lampshades,
 highboys, bookcase foundations, and sometimes  where
it appears in wall paper or Turcoman rug designs)
expresses movement in repose admirably,  and has real
decorative values.</p>

<h3>CURVED FORMS</h3>

<p>Curved forms, the circle, the oval and the ellipse,
are all agreeable. There is in them &ldquo;a hint
of the mysterious dualism of life.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>COLOR</h3>

<p>Colors makes decorative shapes easy to see. (For the
character of the colors and the principles of their
effective combination the reader will find much useful
information in the &ldquo;Color Harmony and Design
in Dress&rdquo; included in this series.) Art, Nature
and books will all help the interior decorator in
the matter of color adjustment. Trim in most houses
compels the adjustment of the color harmony  to suit
it. In general white paneling calls for the use of
one warm and one cool color, while dark brown or black
paneling needs two or more warm colors.</p>

<h3>PROPORTION</h3>

<p>All parts of a furnished room must help express one
ideal of balance. The realization of this ideal is
proportion. A horizontal room calls for horizontal
furniture and lines, a vertical room for vertical ones.
Every important decorative feature of a room must be
selected in accordance with its proportion in general.
 The size of a room increases the form scale (or scale
of the forms) represented by furniture, pictures,
 rugs, <i>etc</i>. In every room the important individual
pieces, such as library table, piano, bed, dresser,
must parallel one or another wall. Do not violate
proportion and artistic effect by overcrowding.</p>

<h2 id="id3">CHAPTER III: INDIVIDUAL ROOMS OF THE HOUSE</h2>

<h3>THE DINING ROOM AND &ldquo;WORK ROOMS&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The dining room, with which we were so directly  concerned
in the preceding portion of this book, offers a natural
point of departure for considering the individual
rooms of the house with regard to decoration. First,
as to a dominant dining room color: The dining room
should be a room of good cheer, a bright, happy room.
But it should not be too bright. If it is on the sunny
side of the house, let one of the colors dominate&mdash;white,
cream white, blues, greens, grays or violet&mdash;
if on the shady side, gain warmth by the use of yellows
(save lemon), orange, warm tans, russets, pinks, yellowish
greens and reds. (This applies to all rooms.)</p>

<p>Do not use restless-patterned wall papers. Leather
(used with paneling or above wainscot), modern tapestries,
fabrics of all kinds are suitable for covering  dining-room
walls. If low, the ceiling should never be dark, since
this makes the room appear still lower. (A breakfast
room done in lacquer is very effective, however, if
not too low.) A single large rug, harmonizing with
the wall color scheme is admirable in any room. In
the dining room, however, a figured carpet is often
preferred for practical reasons: it stands wear and
tear around the table better. Well-chosen paper (See
Chapter II) often improves a badly proportioned room
by optical illusion. The ideal lightings for dining
rooms are side lights. Dining-room drop lights or domes
are very trying to the eyes of those who dine, and
are unbecoming. Side lights (adding candles for grace
and charm) are far pleasanter to the eyes and look
better.</p>

<p>In the dining room the table is the dominating furniture
note. A round table, an oblong table or a square table
may be the more desirable according  to the shape
of the room. But a round dining table may be harmonized
with an oblong dining room by means of an oblong rug,
with rounded medallion, by a round flower bowl, a
round tray or even the wheels of the tea table. In
the dining room, as elsewhere, repetition in color
establishes the color tone of the room. In the dining
room, as elsewhere, every individual room presents
an individual case, to be worked out decoratively
in accordance with the principles already given. One
more color hint regarding the dining room, drawn from
a modern authority: &ldquo;When we think of the ideal
dinner&mdash;the soft lights, the hospitable
warmth, the sparkle of crystal, the gleam of silver,
the quick talk and gay laughter of the guests&mdash;we
think of <i>red,</i> for that color is indissolubly
bound in thought with the idea of richness, hospitality
and excitement.&rdquo; Yet red, as we will see later,
is a color to be used with great caution.</p>

<h3>WORKING ROOMS VERSUS LIVING ROOMS</h3>

<p>Before passing to the other rooms of the house, we
will pause to consider a more purely utilitarian group.</p>

<p><i>The Kitchen</i>.&mdash;These rooms which are
strictly utilitarian, more or less escape decorative
control. The kitchen, aside from the elements of proportion
in arrangement of its furnishings, is not properly
a room for decoration. A cheerful color, plenty of
light&mdash;a practical essential&mdash;and
practical arrangement  of its furniture and equipment
are of more importance than the decorative element.
Neatness, color harmony and a restful eye effect should
be obtained. This applies as well to the butler&rsquo;s
pantry. Pantry and kitchen should always be shut off
from the dining room, so that the latter&rsquo;s decorative
values are not affected by them.</p>

<p><i>The Bathroom</i>.&mdash;Tiled or hardwood
flooring, painted or glazed washable walls, sanitary
plumbing,  glass shelves, washable cotton rugs and
bath mats, all the modern conveniences in keeping with
the purposes of the room, thrust the decorative element
 into the background. The curtains must be simple
and quite easily washed.</p>

<p><i>The Home Sewing Room</i>.&mdash;The home sewing
room, too, may be viewed decoratively as well as practically.
A sunny room with western exposure, kalsomined in
pale warm gray, the floor covered with cream-colored
matting, windows fitted with white Holland shades&mdash;a
combination restful to the eye&mdash;and furnished
with hard-wood framed, cane-bottomed  chairs.</p>

<h2 id="id4">CHAPTER IV: LIVING ROOM, DRAWING ROOM AND LIBRARY</h2>

<p>We now return to the rooms where decoration is the
rule. While always remembering that connecting rooms
must harmonize with one another in color, individual
colors may always be appropriately chosen for certain
rooms, because they express the dominant mood and character
of the room in question. Thus, for the living room
or drawing room, the yellows, oranges and golden browns,
which combine the cheer of yellow and the warmth of
red, are excellent. If a restful instead of a cheerful
quality is desired for the living room or drawing room,
green may be made the dominant hue. Yellow is a joyous
tint, also a good breakfast-room hue. It will harmonize
in the living room with plain fumed oak, willow furniture
and cretonne hangings as well as with painted and
paneled ivory walls, old Chinese rugs, damask hangings
and satinwood and lacquered furniture. But furniture,
bric-a-brac and walls always <i>must</i> be good in
line and color. For proper floor balance use a large
rug in a large living room, and several small ones
in a small one. Furniture, too, should be chosen in
view of the emphasis each individual piece has; and
its relations to the room in general. The effect of
stiffness is not overcome by placing heavy pieces of
furniture  askew in a room. Yet this is often done.
Scale and proportion should always dictate the choice
of furniture, lamps and pictures. Each has its place
in the general decorative scheme. Red is a hard color
for the eyes. Many a red living room has been the cause
of chronic headache. Not that red need be entirely
tabooed. A living room for example, paneled in oak,
with a soft red-toned Oriental  rug, red draperies,
a touch of red in a stained glass window panel, and
red cushioned window seat will have far more warmth
and charm than a room whose walls are completely covered
with red.</p>

<p><i>The Hall and Library</i>.&mdash;Red, however,
makes a hall seem hospitable and full of welcome.
It is also a good library color. In halls where walls
are papered or paneled with stripes or draperies rich
red may appear in the ground of an Oriental rug on
the floor, and be matched in the hue of the portières
or stair runner. With damask or tapestry, or large-figured
duplex papered hall walls, a soft-toned red rug, with
hangings and stair runner matching it, is best. The
walls should show a neutral tint, and red will dominate
with pleasing effect.</p>

<p>In the library, in winter, with a glow from the open
fire playing over a red rug, &ldquo;revealing shadowy
 outline of bookcases, and dim velvet draperies, as
a deep-shaded lamp throws a beam of light over the
arm of a big reading chair,&rdquo; red seems indeed
an ideal color for the room.</p>

<h2 id="id5">CHAPTER V: BED ROOM, NURSERY AND PLAY ROOM</h2>

<p>For the bedroom, though other colors such as green
and violet, in particular (save red, which is a poor
bedroom hue) are not barred, blue is an ideal color,
expressive of repose and tranquil ease. In the bedroom,
however, as in all other rooms, the light and location
must always be considered in establishing the color
note. Curtains either make or mar a room, especially
a bedroom. Bedroom curtains, whether of expensive
or cheap material, must emphasize the restful charm
of the room. If a bedroom (or other room) is plain
in color, the curtains may be either plain or figured.
But it is dangerous when wall designs of bedrooms
is apt to convey a feeling of restlessness. The bedroom
may be provided with one large or several smaller
rugs as a floor covering, according to size. Plain
rugs are more restful in effect, and with plain walls
and chintz often present a charming effect.</p>

<h3>NURSERY AND PLAY ROOM</h3>

<p>These children&rsquo;s rooms should always give out
a gay and cheerful atmosphere. To obtain this wall
papers with colorful friezes with characters from
fairy tale, Mother Goose or Noah&rsquo;s Ark, may be
used above a simple wainscot. Painted walls with stenciled
designs are also attractive. Small chairs and tables
with good lines, a bookcase, a toy cupboard, a sand
table, and window boxes where the children may plant
seeds, are all possible decorative units of such a
room. The general color scheme must be soft and cheerful,
plain linoleum is the best floor covering, the few
pictures should hang low, and the window curtains
should be of white muslin, with side hangings (down
to sill) with some special nursery design in cretonne.</p>

<h2 id="id6">CHAPTER VI: SOME HINTS ANENT PERIOD FURNITURE</h2>

<p>Period furniture is a means to a decorative end. It
is a <i>part</i> of the decoration of a room, and
must be adapted to its lines and proportions. Halls
for instance, call for tall chairs and cabinets and
long and narrow wall tables. Pictures and bric-a-brac
 are out of place in the hall. In the living room,
where spaciousness and repose are wanted, substantial,
comfortable chairs, long, low sofas, cabinets and
tables, and no fussy furniture adjuncts are demanded.
Similarly in the dining room, the furniture lines
should make the room a more comfortable  and restful
one in which to eat; and bedroom  furniture must in
all decorative ways carry out the idea of rest and
sleeping. If period furniture  is used, the drawing
room usually gives the dominant note, which should
be carried out (in more or less modified form) throughout
the other rooms. Do not make too abrupt contrasts in
using period furniture. Late Louis XVI and Early Empire
 have much in common. But it is a shock to find Louis
XV and Late Empire in the same room. Sheraton and
Rococo, Early Jacobean oak and late eighteenth century
English mahogany do not mix. If your rooms are Colonial
use Colonial or Georgian styles of furniture. For
ball rooms, small reception rooms, and the boudoirs
of blooming young beauty&mdash;not  those of dignified
old age&mdash;Louis XV is to be commended. Formal
dining rooms stand Louis XV and Louis XVI styles very
well. On the other hand the simple beauty of line
of Adam, Sheraton, Heppelwhite and Chippendale are
better suited to simpler rooms&mdash;though they
may be quite as subtly and perfectly finished. In
general, the choice of all furniture&mdash;chairs,
tables, beds, mirrors&mdash;should be influenced
by the size of the house and rooms, individual circumstances
and individual taste, where the last does not conflict
with established laws of decoration.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>Interior Decoration is a very extensive and complicated
 subject. What we have here attempted to do has been
to give an idea of the general principles  underlying
it, together with as many direct and practical hints
and suggestions as has been possible within the limits
allotted. It is hoped that they may lead the reader
to take a more personal interest in a fascinating
subject of study. If this be the case, a large number
of specialized works which treat every least phase
of &ldquo;Interior Decoration&rdquo;  in exhaustive
detail, are available. </p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
